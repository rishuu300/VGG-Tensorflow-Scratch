# VGG Neural Network Implementation in TensorFlow

This repository contains a TensorFlow/Keras implementation of the **VGG** architecture, a classic convolutional neural network (CNN) used for image classification tasks.

The implementation is educational â€” designed for learning purposes â€” and provides a clear walkthrough of the VGG network structure.

## ðŸ“– About VGG Networks

The VGG family of networks (VGG16, VGG19) introduced by Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford are known for:

- Using **small (3x3)** convolution filters.
- **Increasing depth** significantly compared to earlier networks.
- Very **uniform and clean architecture** (easy to extend and modify).
